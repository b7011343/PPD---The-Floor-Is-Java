# PPD---The-Floor-Is-Java

This is a basic canvas based game built using the P5 JavaScript framework. The project was set as a first year university assignment, and is based off games such as geometry dash. The game and physics engines are both built completely from scratch, however it is by no means a finished product, and there are several improvements that could be made.

Development Team: Joe Smithurst, Jacob Whitehead, Connor Proffitt & George Stanley
